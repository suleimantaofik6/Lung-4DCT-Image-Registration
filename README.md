# Lung-4DCT-Image-Registration
This project explores five different methods for registering inhale and exhale lung CT scans from the DIR Lab COPDGene dataset. The registration methods implemented include Elastix and Transformix, an intensity based image registration algorithm, and compared its performance with several pre trained deep learning algorithms from Monai
